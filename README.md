# Fitlit Wellness Tracker

#### [Project Spec](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/fitlit.html)

##### Week 8 (Mod2) at Turing School of Software and Design

## Project Description

Use our app along with and run a local server from your machine by following the set-up instructions to fetch mock user data to populate the page with new user data everytime the page is loaded.

This project:
  - This project implements the fetch API to access data from a local server.
  - This project uses array prototype methods.
  - /// responsive.
  - This project uses the fetch API to make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data.

 
### Built-By:

[Stephanie Magdic](https://github.com/stephaniemagdic)
[Sarah Rudy](https://github.com/sarahrudy)


### Technologies Used 

* JavaScript (ECMAScript 2009)
* NPM packages/dependencies: 
  * [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
  * [Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack): a helpful developer tool (npm package we install as a dev dependency)
* Mocha test framework and Chai TDD assertion library


### Architecture

* dist directory
  * [bundle.js](https://www.simplethread.com/javascript-modules-and-code-bundling-explained/): our minified file that webpack creates for our browser!
  * index.html 
* src directory
  * ES6 class files
    * Class Structure Example:
      * UserSleepRepository: holds sleep data for `all` users. Has methods that uses/manipulates just all users data. 
      * UserSleepData: holds sleep data for `one` user. Has methods that uses/manipulates just one user's data.  
  * scripts.js: holds our application logic, including fetching data from our local server and manipulating the dom.
* test directory
* README.md
