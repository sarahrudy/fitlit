- we like the concept of having a totals column with visuals to support the data
- we also like the reference to all products/projects at the top of the page

- we really like how clean these icons are and would like to implement this into our project 

- we're thinking we will use an icon for each data file (hydration, sleep, activity, and user profile)

- we like the idea of having a navigation sidebar so the user can navigate back to where they want to be easily from every page 
- we are going to plan to use the icons from design inspiration 2 in the navigation sidebar
